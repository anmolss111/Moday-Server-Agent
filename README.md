# Moday-Server-Agent 2020
All developers has to write a lot of code when developing the backend of the application. You need to write the models corresponding to the schema of tables. Then need to write the serializers corresponding to the models and then expose all the views separately for all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations separately. We can write the code and then modularise it. But we canâ€™t visualize it, we need to create a separate copy of the ER (Entity relationship) diagram and need to keep it updated. We also need to keep track of the modules as well as the subcomponents of the system. Then making changes in the code need to update the docs. What if i told you can have a boilerplate code for your application with a visualisation available.
